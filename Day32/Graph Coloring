Graph coloring refers to the problem of coloring vertices of a graph in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is also called the vertex coloring problem. If coloring is done using at most m colors, it is called m-coloring.

Chromatic Number:
The minimum number of colors needed to color a graph is called its chromatic number. For example, the following can be colored a minimum of 2 colors.

Example of Chromatic Number

The problem of finding a chromatic number of a given graph is NP-complete.
Graph coloring problem is both, a decision problem as well as an optimization problem.
A decision problem is stated as, “With given M colors and graph G, whether a such color scheme is possible or not?”.
The optimization problem is stated as, “Given M colors and graph G, find the minimum number of colors required for graph coloring.”

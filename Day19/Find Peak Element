Given an array which contains integer values, we need to make all values of this array equal to some integer value with minimum cost where the cost of changing an array value x to y is abs(x-y). 

Examples : 

Input  : arr[] = [1, 100, 101]
Output : 100
We can change all its values to 100 with minimum cost,
|1 - 100| + |100 - 100| + |101 - 100| = 100
Input  : arr[] = [4, 6]
Output : 2
We can change all its values to 5 with minimum cost,
|4 - 5| + |5 - 6| = 2

This problem can be solved by observing the cost while changing the target equal value, i.e. we will see the change in cost when target equal value is changed. It can be observed that, as we increase the target equal value the total cost decreases up to a limit and then starts increasing i.e. the cost graph with respect to target equal value is of U-shape and as cost graph is in U-shape, the ternary search can be applied to this search space and our goal is to get that bottom most point of the curve which will represent the smallest cost. We will make smallest and largest value of the array as the limit of our search space and then we will keep skipping 1/3 part of the search space until we reach to the bottom most point of our U-curve.

C++ Solution

int computeCost(int arr[], int N, int X)
{
    int cost = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        cost += abs(arr[i] - X);
    return cost;
}
int minCostToMakeElementEqual(int arr[], int N)
{
    int low, high;
    low = high = arr[0];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        if (low > arr[i])
            low = arr[i];
        if (high < arr[i])
            high = arr[i];
    }
    while ((high - low) > 2) {
        int mid1 = low + (high - low) / 3;
        int mid2 = high - (high - low) / 3;
 
        int cost1 = computeCost(arr, N, mid1);
        int cost2 = computeCost(arr, N, mid2);

        if (cost1 < cost2)
            high = mid2;
        else
            low = mid1;
    }
    return computeCost(arr, N, (low + high) / 2);
}

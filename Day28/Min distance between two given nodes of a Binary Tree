Given a binary tree with n nodes and two node values, a and b, your task is to find the minimum distance between them. The given two nodes are guaranteed to be in the binary tree and all node values are unique.

Example 1:
Input:
        1
      /  \
     2    3
a = 2, b = 3
Output: 
2
Explanation: 
We need the distance between 2 and 3. Being at node 2, we need to take two steps ahead in order to reach node 3. The path followed will be: 2 -> 1 -> 3. Hence, the result is 2. 
Example 2:

Input:
        11
      /   \
     22  33
    /  \  /  \
  44 55 66 77
a = 77, b = 22
Output: 
3
Explanation: 
We need the distance between 77 and 22. Being at node 77, we need to take three steps ahead in order to reach node 22. The path followed will be: 77 -> 33 -> 11 -> 22. Hence, the result is 3.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findDist() which takes the root node of the tree and the two node values a and b as input parameters and returns the minimum distance between the nodes represented by the two given node values.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the Tree).

Constraints:
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= Data of a node <= 109

}; */

class Solution{
    public:
    Node* findLCA(Node* root, int a, int b) {
        if (!root) return nullptr;

        Node* leftLCA = findLCA(root->left, a, b);
        Node* rightLCA = findLCA(root->right, a, b);
        
        if (leftLCA && rightLCA) return root;
        
        return (leftLCA != nullptr) ? leftLCA : rightLCA;
    }
    int findDistance(Node* root, int value, int distance) {
        if (!root) return -1;
        if (root->data == value) return distance;
        
        int leftDistance = findDistance(root->left, value, distance + 1);
        if (leftDistance != -1) return leftDistance;
        
        return findDistance(root->right, value, distance + 1);
    }
    
    int findDist(Node* root, int a, int b) {

        Node* lca = findLCA(root, a, b);

        int distA = findDistance(lca, a, 0);
        int distB = findDistance(lca, b, 0);

        return distA + distB;
    }
};
